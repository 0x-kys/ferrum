# Ferrum

Implementing a shell to learn Rust.

### Unique Commands

| Command    | Use              | Usage                 |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| `setpath`  | `setpath <path>` | adds a directory path |
| `showpath` | `showpath`       | show current paths    |

### ToDo

- TOML config for paths
- trim subdirectory name to single character
- add some shorthands for commands like `ls -l` -> `ll`
- directory and file highlighting
- tab completion for paths and commands
- alias for commands
- make docs
